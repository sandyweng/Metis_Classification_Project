Predicting Whether Kickstarter Project will be Successful
Sandy Weng
Abstract
The purpose of this project was to use classification models to predict whether
Kickstarter campaigns be successful. I worked with data scraped by web robots and 
used numeric and categorial features to achieve this goal. 
Design
The dataset contains 171,251 projects with 20 features, of which 3 are numerical. Some 
of the features include the funding goal, category, and campaign duration. I used f-beta 
score (beta=0.5) as the metric because I want high precision but still consider the recall 
score. 
Algorithms
Feature Engineering
1. Converting categorical features to binary dummy variables.
2. Extracting the month and day of the week when the projects launched.
3. Subtracted the deadline from launched date to obtain the project duration.
Models
Logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, and random forest classifiers were used before 
settling on random forest as the model with best f-beta score. 
Model Evaluation and Selection
The data was split into 80/20 train vs test sets, and all the scores were calculated with 
10-fold cross validation on the training portion only. Predictions were done on the 20% 
holdout at the end after picking the model with the best f-beta score, so the scores were 
only seen once.
Final random forest 10-fold CV scores: 
• Precision: 0.7259, 
• Recall: 0.8038, 
• F-beta score: 0.7402
Test Set
• Precision: 0. 0.7355
• Recall 0. 8168
• F-beta score: 0.7504
Tools• Numpy and Pandas for EDA
• Scikit-learn for modeling
• Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Tableau for visualizations
Communication
• Presentation and slide
